## 📜 The Origin Story
**LOUD AND CLEAR:** This entire project was **generated by AI**.

I (`heavenly`) acted as the **Patriarch** (Prompter & Tester), issuing decrees to my digital disciples:
* **Jules (Google):** The Architect who wrote the core code, structure, and logic.
* **Gemini (VS Code):** The Steward who debugged errors, fixed CSS layering issues, and optimized the "Vibe."

I did not write the syntax manually. I directed the *vision*, tested the *output*, and refined the *experience*. This repository serves as a **Template** for other "Vibe Coders" who want a high-quality, static portfolio without getting bogged down in frameworks.

## 🏯 Features (Techniques)

This is a **Multi-Page Static App (MPA)** that feels like a modern Single Page App (SPA), but with zero dependencies.

* **The Scripture Library (Blog):** A dynamic reading interface that fetches article content from JSON.
* **The Treasure Hall (Portfolio):** Displays projects with distinct visual styles for "Live Apps" (Gold) vs "Downloadable Manuals" (Silver).
* **The Hall of Records (Gallery):** A filterable media gallery for Audio, Video, and Images.
* **The Cultivation Tree:** A pure CSS/JS visualization of your skill hierarchy (Parent/Child nodes).
* **The Heavenly Eye:** A global search bar that instantly filters through all content in `data.json`.
* **Sect Atmosphere:** Lightweight HTML5 Canvas particle effects ("Falling Petals") optimized for 60fps.
* **Mobile-First Design:** Fully responsive sidebar drawer with custom scrollbars and "Hero" scaling.

## 🛠️ The Sect Rules (Tech Stack)

We followed a strict **"Code of Honor"** during generation:
1.  **Zero Frameworks:** No React, No Vue, No Tailwind. Just pure HTML5/CSS3.
2.  **No Inline Styles:** All CSS must live in `assets/css/style.css`.
3.  **No Inline Scripts:** All Logic must live in `assets/js/`.
4.  **JSON Driven:** All content (blogs, projects, skills) is loaded from `data/data.json`. You don't need to edit HTML to add a new project.
5.  **Remixicons Only:** Strict icon consistency.
